Pipeline Idle Monitor
======================

In some cases, it may be necessary to actively monitor the pipeline for periods of inactivity.
Pipeline Idle Monitor is a monitoring tool designed to observe the activity and performance of data pipelines, ensuring they remain operational and effective.


Design
-------

Pipeline Idle Monitor is a separate component within the pipeline topology. It interacts with the pipeline containers using the Docker client.

.. note::
    Requires access to the Docker daemon socket to manage the services in the pipeline.

Monitoring is based on the use of :ref:`savant_101/10_adapters:Buffer Bridge Adapter`, which provides information on the number of incoming and outgoing messages, called metrics.
Metrics characterize services connected to the buffer adapter's input and output.

Pipeline Idle Monitor is designed to detect the following conditions based on specific metrics:

- No data has been received for a certain period, indicating that the downstream adapters are not receiving any data.
- No data has been sent for a certain period, indicating that the preceding adapters are not transmitting data.
- The buffer is overloaded, indicating that the downstream adapters cannot process the data at the expected rate.

There can be multiple buffer adapters in the pipeline, and each of them is monitored separately by a single Pipeline Idle Monitor.

The source code and further details can be found in the `PipelineWatchdog <https://github.com/insight-platform/PipelineWatchdog>`__ repository.

Using Pipeline Idle Monitor
--------------------------------

Pipeline Idle Monitor is configured using a YAML configuration file.

The configuration file contains three main sections describing how to watch the buffer's state:

- **queue** - defines the condition for the buffer adapter to be considered overloaded
- **egress** - defines the period for which the downstream adapters should be considered idle if no data has been sent
- **ingress** - defines the period for which the preceding adapters should be considered idle if no data has been received

.. note::
    At least one of the **queue**, **egress**, or **ingress** sections must be defined.

Each section also defines the action to be taken when the corresponding condition is met. Two possible actions are **restart** and **stop**.

Action is applied to the services that match the container configuration.
The **labels** field can contain a single label key, a label key with a value, or a list of one or more such values. If the list is specified, the action is applied to the services with all the labels.
If multiple **labels** fields are specified, the action applies to services matching any of the fields.

Let's consider the following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    container:
       - labels: [label=1, label2]
       - labels: label3

In this case, the action applies to the services with the labels **label=1** and **label2** or **label3**.

.. note::
    If no containers are matched by labels, the action is considered successful, and monitoring continues.

When the action is applied, Pipeline Idle Monitor waits for the specified period (**cooldown**) before rechecking the condition.
In the other case, it will use the **polling_interval** parameter for waiting to prevent checking metrics repeatedly in a short period.

.. tip::
    It is recommended to set the **cooldown** parameter depending on the initialization time of services that could potentially be affected by the action so that the service has time to restart and start processing data.

Time parameters are specified as a string with a number and a unit. The following units are supported:

- **s** - seconds
- **m** - minutes
- **h** - hours
- **d** - days
- **w** - weeks

You can specify the described parameters for one or more buffer adapters in the pipeline.

Example
^^^^^^^^

For example, you can automatically restart a part of the pipeline when no data has been received for a certain period or stop a specific service when the buffer is overloaded. Then, the configuration file will look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    watch:
       - buffer: buffer1:8000
         ingress:
          action: restart
          cooldown: 60s
          idle: 100s
          container:
             - labels: label2
             - labels: label3
         queue:
          action: stop
          length: 999
          cooldown: 60s
          polling_interval: 10s
          container:
             - labels: label1
